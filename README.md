### `Planning`
Creating a Toolchain from Scratch
A JavaScript build toolchain typically consists of:

- `Yarn` Package manager -  It lets you take advantage of a vast ecosystem of third-party packages, and easily install or update them.
- `webpack` Bundler - It lets you write modular code and bundle it together into small packages to optimize load time.
- `Babel` Compiler - It lets you write modern JavaScript code that still works in older browsers.
